Audio is the range of sounds (=audible sounds) that a person can hear. Audio frequencies are electronic alternating current (AC) in the range of 20 to 20,000 Hz (cycles per second), which can produce audible sounds. In computers, audio is a sound system that can be included or added to a computer. The audio card includes a special built-in processor and memory designed to process audio files and send them to the computer's speakers. Audio files are recorded by capturing sound for later playback.
